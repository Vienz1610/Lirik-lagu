    <p>
        I won't lie to you <br/>
        I know he's just not right for you <br/>
        And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face <br/>
        When you say that he's the one that you want <br/>
        And you're spendin' all your time in this wrong situation <br/>
        And anytime you want it to stop <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        I know I can treat you better than he can <br/>
        And any girl like you deserves a gentleman <br/>
        Tell me, why are we wasting time on all your wasted cryin' <br/>
        When you should be with me instead? <br/>
        I know I can treat you better, better than he can <br/></p>
    <p>
        I'll stop time for you <br/>
        The second you say you'd like me to <br/>
        I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing <br/>
        Baby, just to wake up with you <br/>
        Would be everything I need, and this could be so different <br/>
        Tell me what you want to do <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can <br/>
        And any girl like you deserves a gentleman <br/>
        Tell me, why are we wasting time on all your wasted cryin' <br/>
        When you should be with me instead? <br/>
        I know I can treat you better, better than he can <br/>
        Better than he can <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Give me a sign, take my hand, we'll be fine <br/>
        Promise I won't let you down <br/>
        Just know that you don't have to do this alone <br/>
        Promise I'll never let you down <br/>
    <p>
        'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can <br/>
        And any girl like you deserves a gentleman <br/>
        Tell me, why are we wasting time on all your wasted cryin' <br/>
        When you should be with me instead? <br/>
        I know I can treat you better, better than he can, oh <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Better than he can <br/>
        Better than he can
